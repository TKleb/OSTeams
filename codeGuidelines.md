# Code Guidelines
## Overall
Editor Settings:
- Identations should be made with the Tabulator and it should use 4 spaces.
  
### Class names
All Class names should be named like a noun and start with a capital letter. e.g: Module

### Function names
All functions should be named in the lower camel case style. We don't use any prefixes. The name should explain what the function does. e.g: addNumbers(x, y)

### Variable names
Variable names should always be in the lower camel case style.

### Comments
Following the Clean Code principle we try to not have any comments in the code.

### Braces
When defining functions we always put the opening bracket on the same line as the definition. e.g:
function addNumbers(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

### Exception handling
Open to discussion if we want to return error codes or throw exceptions...
